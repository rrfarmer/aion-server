# Phase 6 Session 2146 Handoff - FindGroup Action 10 Direct Packet Trace

Date: 2026-06-02
Unit of Work: UOW-2146
Status: Completed

## Startup Instructions

Future Phase 6 sessions should read:

1. `docs/csharp-port.md`
2. `docs/orchestration-rules.md`
3. `docs/parity-verification.md`
4. latest `docs/Phase-6-Session-*-Completion.md`
5. latest `docs/Phase-6-Session-*-Handoff.md`

Do not read `docs/PHASE-6-PROGRESS.md` during normal startup. It is historical archive material only.

Focused validation is the default. Do not run the broad .NET suite or full solution build unless a documented broad-validation trigger applies. Each completion/handoff should record the exact focused command and the reason broad validation was skipped or run.

## Current State

- Phase 6 remains in progress.
- Java remains the source of truth.
- Live `CM_FIND_GROUP` dispatch remains deferred in `GameServerConnection.ProcessPacketAsync`.
- `GameServerConnection.CreateDisabledFindGroupBoundaryPlan` can compose non-live boundary plans but is not invoked live.
- Actions `0`, `4`, `8`, `10`, `11`, and `15` have disabled-boundary-plus-opt-in direct-packet execution trace evidence.
- Action `10` form-anywhere evidence records optional action `26` mask-list direct send before the action `10` show-list direct send.
- Actions `1` and `5` have disabled-boundary-plus-opt-in world-broadcast fanout trace evidence.
- Action `12` accepted group and alliance replies have disabled-boundary-plus-opt-in invite-request ordering trace evidence.
- Action `12` declined whisper, missing applicant, missing instance group, and missing invite player cases have focused disabled evidence.
- `FindGroupSideEffectDispatchExecutorService` records opt-in direct/broadcast execution order, but not live boundary execution.
- `FindGroupDirectPacketTriggerOrderingReadinessService` blocks live direct-packet ordering claims.
- `FindGroupWorldBroadcastFanoutReadinessService` blocks live world-broadcast fanout claims for actions `1` and `5`.
- `FindGroupConcurrentMutationOrderingReadinessService` records deterministic shared-singleton interleaving fixtures but still blocks live singleton interleaving claims.
- `PHASE-6-PROGRESS.md` remained untouched.

## UOW-2146 Summary

This UOW added focused readiness evidence for Java `CM_FIND_GROUP` action `10`:

- Java action `10` calls `FindGroupService.showInstanceGroups(player, false)`.
- Java `showInstanceGroups` sends optional `new SM_FIND_GROUP(instanceMaskIds)` first when form-anywhere is enabled and this is not an update.
- Java then sends `new SM_FIND_GROUP(10, instanceGroups)` to the active player.
- C# disabled boundary composes normal action `10` as a direct `SmFindGroup` show-list intent.
- C# disabled boundary composes form-anywhere action `10` as action `26` mask-list intent followed by action `10` show-list intent.
- Focused tests record disabled action `10` acceptance before opt-in registry direct-packet execution, including mask-list-before-show-list ordering.
- Readiness reports now distinguish action `0`/`4`/`8`/`10`/`11`/`15` disabled direct-packet trace evidence from still-missing live `ProcessPacketAsync` direct-packet proof.

## Java Artifacts Touched

- `com.aionemu.gameserver.network.aion.clientpackets.CM_FIND_GROUP`
- `com.aionemu.gameserver.services.findgroup.FindGroupService`
- `com.aionemu.gameserver.services.findgroup.FindGroupService.showInstanceGroups`
- `com.aionemu.gameserver.utils.PacketSendUtility.sendPacket`

## C# Artifacts Touched

- `Aion.GameServer.Network.Aion.ClientPackets.CmFindGroup`
- `Aion.GameServer.Network.Aion.GameServerConnection`
- `Aion.GameServer.Services.FindGroupRecruitmentPlanService`
- `Aion.GameServer.Services.FindGroupConnectionClientActionCompositionPlanService`
- `Aion.GameServer.Services.FindGroupDirectPacketBoundaryTraceReadinessService`
- `Aion.GameServer.Services.FindGroupDirectPacketTriggerOrderingReadinessService`
- `Aion.GameServer.Services.FindGroupLiveDispatchReadinessReportService`
- `Aion.GameServer.Services.FindGroupSideEffectDispatchExecutorService`
- `Aion.GameServer.Tests.GameServerConnectionFindGroupBoundaryTests`

## Validation In UOW-2146

Focused C# validation:

```powershell
dotnet test dotnetConversion\tests\Aion.GameServer.Tests\Aion.GameServer.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~GameServerConnectionFindGroupBoundaryTests|FullyQualifiedName~FindGroupDirectPacketBoundaryTraceReadinessServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~FindGroupDirectPacketTriggerOrderingReadinessServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~FindGroupLiveDispatchReadinessReportServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~FindGroupSideEffectDispatchExecutorServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~FindGroupConnectionBoundarySideEffectCompositionEvidenceServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~FindGroupClientActionPlanServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~FindGroupConnectionClientActionCompositionPlanServiceTests" --no-restore
```

Result:

- Passed: 79
- Failed: 0
- Skipped: 0
- Existing unrelated nullable/analyzer warnings were emitted.

Full .NET validation was skipped intentionally because this was a focused test/readiness-report unit with no live dispatch, shared packet primitive, common runtime base, persistence, or solution-wide contract change.

Java/Maven validation was not run because no Java source changed and no narrow executable Java test target was identified for this non-live C# boundary-trace fixture.

## Migration Parity Table

| Java Artifact | C# Artifact | Type | Port Status | Test Status | Parity Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `com.aionemu.gameserver.network.aion.clientpackets.CM_FIND_GROUP` | `Aion.GameServer.Network.Aion.ClientPackets.CmFindGroup` | Client Packet | Partial | Unit Tested | Partial Parity | Action `10` disabled boundary can be parsed/composed and opt-in executed in ordered direct-packet traces. Live `ProcessPacketAsync` dispatch remains disabled. |
| `com.aionemu.gameserver.services.findgroup.FindGroupService.showInstanceGroups` | `Aion.GameServer.Services.FindGroupRecruitmentPlanService.ShowInstanceGroupsForClient` | Service Method | Partial | Unit Tested | Partial Parity | Action `10` filters same-race instance groups and can compose optional action `26` mask-list before action `10` show-list when form-anywhere is enabled. Live socket ordering remains unverified. |
| `com.aionemu.gameserver.utils.PacketSendUtility.sendPacket` | `Aion.GameServer.Services.FindGroupSideEffectDispatchExecutorService.ExecuteAsync` | Dispatch Utility | Partial | Unit Tested | Partial Parity | Opt-in action `10` registry direct sends record mask-list before show-list when applicable and otherwise show-list only. This does not prove live `GameServerConnection` behavior. |
| `com.aionemu.gameserver.network.aion.AionClientPacket.run` | `Aion.GameServer.Network.Aion.GameServerConnection.ProcessPacketAsync` | Connection Boundary | Blocked | Unit Tested | Partial Parity | Java synchronously invokes `runImpl`; C# still defers `CmFindGroup` in `ProcessPacketAsync`, so live trigger-order parity remains blocked. |

## Known Gaps

- Live `CM_FIND_GROUP` execution is still disabled.
- No live `ProcessPacketAsync` trace proves actions `0`, `4`, `8`, `10`, `11`, or `15` direct-packet ordering relative to a triggering live `CM_FIND_GROUP` client packet.
- Action `10` form-anywhere evidence uses injected C# `AutoGroupTable` data and does not prove live `DataManager.AUTO_GROUP` parity.
- Direct packet and world-broadcast action evidence remains non-live until `ProcessPacketAsync` is wired.
- No encrypted socket or real-client comparison covers FindGroup.

## Next Recommended Unit of Work

Next sequential task:

- Add focused direct-action disabled-boundary-plus-opt-in ordered trace evidence for action `13` instance-group update show list, proving update requests emit the action `10` show-list direct packet and do not emit action `26`.

Safe candidates:

- Add focused live-boundary readiness for missing-recipient direct-packet failures.
- Add focused runtime trace scaffolding for FindGroup caller interleavings if a narrow non-invasive hook exists.
- Add a targeted Java/Maven fixture only if a narrow executable Java FindGroup parity target is identified.
